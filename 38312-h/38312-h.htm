<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class = "smcap">here</span> was an air of calm
and reserved opulence about
the Weightman mansion that
spoke not of money squandered,
but of wealth prudently applied.
Standing on a corner of the Avenue no
longer fashionable for residence, it looked
upon the swelling tide of business with
an expression of complacency and half-disdain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">The house was not beautiful. There was
nothing in its straight front of chocolate-colored
stone, its heavy cornices, its broad,
staring windows of plate glass, its carved
and bronze-bedecked mahogany doors at
the top of the wide stoop, to charm the eye
or fascinate the imagination. But it was
eminently respectable, and in its way imposing.
It seemed to say that the glittering
shops of the jewelers, the milliners, the confectioners,
the florists, the picture-dealers,
the furriers, the makers of rare and costly
antiquities, retail traders in luxuries of life,
were beneath the notice of a house that had
its foundations in the high finance, and was
built literally and figuratively in the shadow
of St. Petronius' Church.</p>
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
<p class="noindent">At the same time there was something
self-pleased and congratulatory in the way
in which the mansion held its own amid the
changing neighborhood. It almost seemed
to be lifted up a little, among the tall buildings
near at hand, as if it felt the rising
value of the land on which it stood.</p>
</div>

<p>John Weightman was like the house into
which he had built himself thirty years ago,
and in which his ideals and ambitions were
incrusted. He was a self-made man. But
in making himself he had chosen a highly
esteemed pattern and worked according to
the approved rules. There was nothing irregular,
questionable, flamboyant about
him. He was solid, correct, and justly
successful.</p>

<p>His minor tastes, of course, had been
carefully kept up to date. At the proper
time, pictures by the Barbizon masters,
old English plate and portraits, bronzes by
Barye and marbles by Rodin, Persian carpets
and Chinese porcelains, had been introduced
to the mansion. It contained a
Louis Quinze reception-room, an Empire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>drawing-room, a Jacobean dining-room,
and various apartments dimly reminiscent
of the styles of furniture affected by deceased
monarchs. That the hallways were
too short for the historic perspective did
not make much difference. American decorative
art is <i>capable de tout</i>, it absorbs all
periods. Of each period Mr. Weightman
wished to have something of the best. He
understood its value, present as a certificate,
and prospective as an investment.</p>

<p>It was only in the architecture of his
town house that he remained conservative,
immovable, one might almost say Early-Victorian-Christian.
His country house at
Dulwich-on-the-Sound was a palace of the
Italian Renaissance. But in town he adhered
to an architecture which had moral
associations, the Nineteenth-Century-Brownstone
epoch. It was a symbol of his
social position, his religious doctrine, and
even, in a way, of his business creed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"A man of fixed principles," he would
say, "should express them in the looks of
his house. New York changes its domestic
architecture too rapidly. It is like divorce.
It is not dignified. I don't like it. Extravagance
and fickleness are advertised in
most of these new houses. I wish to be
known for different qualities. Dignity and
prudence are the things that people trust.
Every one knows that I can afford to live
in the house that suits me. It is a guarantee
to the public. It inspires confidence. It
helps my influence. There is a text in the
Bible about 'a house that hath foundations.'
That is the proper kind of a mansion for a
solid man."</p>

<p>Harold Weightman had often listened to
his father discoursing in this fashion on the
fundamental principles of life, and always
with a divided mind. He admired immensely
his father's talents and the single-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>minded
energy with which he improved
them. But in the paternal philosophy there
was something that disquieted and oppressed
the young man, and made him gasp
inwardly for fresh air and free action.</p>

<p>At times, during his college course and
his years at the law school, he had yielded
to this impulse and broken away&mdash;now
toward extravagance and dissipation, and
then, when the reaction came, toward a
romantic devotion to work among the poor.
He had felt his father's disapproval for both
of these forms of imprudence; but it was
never expressed in a harsh or violent way,
always with a certain tolerant patience,
such as one might show for the mistakes
and vagaries of the very young. John
Weightman was not hasty, impulsive, inconsiderate,
even toward his own children.
With them, as with the rest of the world,
he felt that he had a reputation to main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>tain,
a theory to vindicate. He could afford
to give them time to see that he was
absolutely right.</p>

<p>One of his favorite Scripture quotations
was, "Wait on the Lord." He had applied
it to real estate and to people, with profitable
results.</p>

<p>But to human persons the sensation of
being waited for is not always agreeable.
Sometimes, especially with the young, it
produces a vague restlessness, a dumb resentment,
which is increased by the fact
that one can hardly explain or justify it.
Of this John Weightman was not conscious.
It lay beyond his horizon. He did not take
it into account in the plan of life which he
made for himself and for his family as the
sharers and inheritors of his success.</p>

<p>"Father plays us," said Harold, in a
moment of irritation, to his mother, "like
pieces in a game of chess."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear," said that lady, whose faith
in her husband was religious, "you ought
not to speak so impatiently. At least he
wins the game. He is one of the most
respected men in New York. And he is
very generous, too."</p>

<p>"I wish he would be more generous in
letting us be ourselves," said the young
man. "He always has something in view
for us and expects to move us up to it."</p>

<p>"But isn't it always for our benefit?"
replied his mother. "Look what a position
we have. No one can say there is any taint
on our money. There are no rumors about
your father. He has kept the laws of God
and of man. He has never made any mistakes."</p>

<p>Harold got up from his chair and poked
the fire. Then he came back to the ample,
well-gowned, firm-looking lady, and sat
beside her on the sofa. He took her hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
gently and looked at the two rings&mdash;a thin
band of yellow gold, and a small solitaire
diamond&mdash;which kept their place on her
third finger in modest dignity, as if not
shamed, but rather justified, by the splendor
of the emerald which glittered beside them.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, "you have a wonderful
hand. And father made no mistake
when he won you. But are you sure
he has always been so inerrant?"</p>

<p>"Harold," she exclaimed, a little stiffly,
"what do you mean? His life is an open
book."</p>

<p>"Oh," he answered, "I don't mean
anything bad, mother dear. I know the
governor's life is an open book&mdash;a ledger,
if you like, kept in the best bookkeeping
hand, and always ready for inspection&mdash;every
page correct, and showing a handsome
balance. But isn't it a mistake not
to allow us to make our own mistakes, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
learn for ourselves, to live our own lives?
Must we be always working for 'the balance,'
in one thing or another? I want to
be myself&mdash;to get outside of this everlasting,
profitable 'plan'&mdash;to let myself go,
and lose myself for a while at least&mdash;to do
the things that I want to do, just because
I want to do them."</p>

<p>"My boy," said his mother, anxiously,
"you are not going to do anything wrong
or foolish? You know the falsehood of
that old proverb about wild oats."</p>

<p>He threw back his head and laughed.
"Yes, mother," he answered, "I know it
well enough. But in California, you
know, the wild oats are one of the most
valuable crops. They grow all over the
hillsides and keep the cattle and the horses
alive. But that wasn't what I meant&mdash;to
sow wild oats. Say to pick wild flowers,
if you like, or even to chase wild geese&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
do something that seems good to me just
for its own sake, not for the sake of wages
of one kind or another. I feel like a hired
man, in the service of this magnificent
mansion&mdash;say in training for father's place
as majordomo. I'd like to get out some
way, to feel free&mdash;perhaps to do something
for others."</p>

<p>The young man's voice hesitated a little.
"Yes, it sounds like cant, I know, but
sometimes I feel as if I'd like to do some
good in the world, if father only wouldn't
insist upon God's putting it into the ledger."</p>

<p>His mother moved uneasily, and a slight
look of bewilderment came into her face.</p>

<p>"Isn't that almost irreverent?" she
asked. "Surely the righteous must have
their reward. And your father is good.
See how much he gives to all the established
charities, how many things he has
founded. He's always thinking of others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and planning for them. And surely, for
us, he does everything. How well he has
planned this trip to Europe for me and
the girls&mdash;the court-presentation at Berlin,
the season on the Riviera, the visits in
England with the Plumptons and the Halverstones.
He says Lord Halverstone has
the finest old house in Sussex, pure Elizabethan,
and all the old customs are kept up,
too&mdash;family prayers every morning for all
the domestics. By-the-way, you know his
son Bertie, I believe."</p>

<p>Harold smiled a little to himself as he
answered: "Yes, I fished at Catalina Island
last June with the Honorable Ethelbert;
he's rather a decent chap, in spite of his ingrowing
mind. But you?&mdash;mother, you
are simply magnificent! You are father's
masterpiece." The young man leaned over
to kiss her, and went up to the Riding Club
for his afternoon canter in the Park.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>So it came to pass, early in December,
that Mrs. Weightman and her two daughters
sailed for Europe, on their serious
pleasure trip, even as it had been written
in the book of Providence; and John Weightman,
who had made the entry, was left to
pass the rest of the winter with his son and
heir in the brownstone mansion.</p>

<p>They were comfortable enough. The
machinery of the massive establishment
ran as smoothly as a great electric dynamo.
They were busy enough, too. John Weightman's
plans and enterprises were complicated,
though his principle of action was
always simple&mdash;to get good value for every
expenditure and effort. The banking-house
of which he was the chief, the brain, the will,
the absolutely controlling hand, was so admirably
organized that the details of its
direction took but little time. But the
scores of other interests that radiated from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
it and were dependent upon it&mdash;or perhaps
it would be more accurate to say, that contributed
to its solidity and success&mdash;the
many investments, industrial, political, benevolent,
reformatory, ecclesiastical, that
had made the name of Weightman well
known and potent in city, church, and
state, demanded much attention and careful
steering, in order that each might produce
the desired result. There were board meetings
of corporations and hospitals, conferences
in Wall Street and at Albany,
consultations and committee meetings in
the brownstone mansion.</p>

<p>For a share in all this business and its
adjuncts John Weightman had his son in
training in one of the famous law firms
of the city; for he held that banking itself
is a simple affair, the only real difficulties
of finance are on its legal side. Meantime
he wished the young man to meet and know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the men with whom he would have to deal
when he became a partner in the house.
So a couple of dinners were given in the
mansion during December, after which the
father called the son's attention to the fact
that over a hundred million dollars had sat
around the board.</p>

<p>But on Christmas Eve father and son
were dining together without guests, and
their talk across the broad table, glittering
with silver and cut glass, and softly lit by
shaded candles, was intimate, though a
little slow at times. The elder man was
in rather a rare mood, more expansive and
confidential than usual; and, when the
coffee was brought in and they were left
alone, he talked more freely of his personal
plans and hopes than he had ever done
before.</p>

<p>"I feel very grateful to-night," said
he, at last; "it must be something in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
air of Christmas that gives me this feeling
of thankfulness for the many divine mercies
that have been bestowed upon me. All the
principles by which I have tried to guide
my life have been justified. I have never
made the value of this salted almond by
anything that the courts would not uphold,
at least in the long run, and yet&mdash;or wouldn't
it be truer to say and therefore?&mdash;my affairs
have been wonderfully prospered. There's
a great deal in that text 'Honesty is the
best'&mdash;but no, that's not from the Bible,
after all, is it? Wait a moment; there is
something of that kind, I know."</p>

<p>"May I light a cigar, father," said Harold,
turning away to hide a smile, "while
you are remembering the text?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," answered the elder
man, rather shortly; "you know I don't
dislike the smell. But it is a wasteful,
useless habit, and therefore I have never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
practised it. Nothing useless is worth
while, that's my motto&mdash;nothing that does
not bring the reward. Oh, now I recall
the text, 'Verily I say unto you they have
their reward.' I shall ask Doctor Snodgrass
to preach a sermon on that verse
some day."</p>

<p>"Using you as an illustration?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly that; but I could
give him some good material from my own
experience to prove the truth of Scripture.
I can honestly say that there is not one of
my charities that has not brought me in a
good return, either in the increase of influence,
the building up of credit, or the
association with substantial people. Of
course you have to be careful how you give,
in order to secure the best results&mdash;no indiscriminate
giving&mdash;no pennies in beggars'
hats! It has been one of my principles
always to use the same kind of judgment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
charities that I use in my other affairs, and
they have not disappointed me."</p>

<p>"Even the check that you put in the
plate when you take the offertory up the
aisle on Sunday morning?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; though there the influence
is less direct; and I must confess that I
have my doubts in regard to the collection
for Foreign Missions. That always seems
to me romantic and wasteful. You never
hear from it in any definite way. They
say the missionaries have done a good deal
to open the way for trade; perhaps&mdash;but
they have also gotten us into commercial
and political difficulties. Yet I give to
them&mdash;a little&mdash;it is a matter of conscience
with me to identify myself with all the enterprises
of the Church; it is the mainstay of
social order and a prosperous civilization.
But the best forms of benevolence are the
well-established, organized ones here at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
home, where people can see them and know
what they are doing."</p>

<p>"You mean the ones that have a local
habitation and a name."</p>

<p>"Yes; they offer by far the safest return,
though of course there is something gained
by contributing to general funds. A public
man can't afford to be without public spirit.
But on the whole I prefer a building, or an
endowment. There is a mutual advantage
to a good name and a good institution in
their connection in the public mind. It
helps them both. Remember that, my
boy. Of course at the beginning you will
have to practise it in a small way; later,
you will have larger opportunities. But
try to put your gifts where they can be
identified and do good all around. You'll
see the wisdom of it in the long run."</p>

<p>"I can see it already, sir, and the way
you describe it looks amazingly wise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
prudent. In other words, we must cast
our bread on the waters in large loaves,
carried by sound ships marked with the
owner's name, so that the return freight will
be sure to come back to us."</p>

<p>The father laughed, but his eyes were
frowning a little as if he suspected something
irreverent under the respectful reply.</p>

<p>"You put it humorously, but there's
sense in what you say. Why not? God
rules the sea; but He expects us to follow
the laws of navigation and commerce. Why
not take good care of your bread, even when
you give it away?"</p>

<p>"It's not for me to say why not&mdash;and yet
I can think of cases&mdash;" The young man
hesitated for a moment. His half-finished
cigar had gone out. He rose and tossed it
into the fire, in front of which he remained
standing&mdash;a slender, eager, restless young
figure, with a touch of hunger in the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
face, strangely like and unlike the father, at
whom he looked with half-wistful curiosity.</p>

<p>"The fact is, sir," he continued, "there
is such a case in my mind now, and it
is a good deal on my heart, too. So I
thought of speaking to you about it to-night.
You remember Tom Rollins, the Junior who
was so good to me when I entered college?"</p>

<p>The father nodded. He remembered very
well indeed the annoying incidents of his
son's first escapade, and how Rollins had
stood by him and helped to avoid a public
disgrace, and how a close friendship had
grown between the two boys, so different
in their fortunes.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I remember him. He
was a promising young man. Has he succeeded?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly&mdash;that is, not yet. His
business has been going rather badly. He
has a wife and little baby, you know. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
now he has broken down,&mdash;something wrong
with his lungs. The doctor says his only
chance is a year or eighteen months in Colorado.
I wish we could help him."</p>

<p>"How much would it cost?"</p>

<p>"Three or four thousand, perhaps, as
a loan."</p>

<p>"Does the doctor say he will get well?"</p>

<p>"A fighting chance&mdash;the doctor says."</p>

<p>The face of the older man changed subtly.
Not a line was altered, but it seemed to have
a different substance, as if it were carved out
of some firm, imperishable stuff.</p>

<p>"A fighting chance," he said, "may do
for a speculation, but it is not a good investment.
You owe something to young Rollins.
Your grateful feeling does you credit. But
don't overwork it. Send him three or four
hundred, if you like. You'll never hear from
it again, except in the letter of thanks. But
for Heaven's sake don't be sentimental.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Religion is not a matter of sentiment; it's a
matter of principle."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs02.jpg" width="400" height="378" alt="&quot;It is not a good investment&quot;" title="&quot;It is not a good investment&quot;" />
</div>

<p>The face of the younger man changed
now. But instead of becoming fixed and
graven, it seemed to melt into life by the
heat of an inward fire. His nostrils quivered
with quick breath, his lips were curled.</p>

<p>"Principle!" he said. "You mean principal&mdash;and
interest too. Well, sir, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
know best whether that is religion or not.
But if it is, count me out, please. Tom
saved me from going to the devil, six years
ago; and I'll be damned if I don't help him
to the best of my ability now."</p>

<p>John Weightman looked at his son steadily.
"Harold," he said at last, "you
know I dislike violent language, and it
never has any influence with me. If I
could honestly approve of this proposition
of yours, I'd let you have the money; but I
can't; it's extravagant and useless. But
you have your Christmas check for a thousand
dollars coming to you to-morrow. You
can use it as you please. I never interfere
with your private affairs."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Harold. "Thank
you very much! But there's another private
affair. I want to get away from this
life, this town, this house. It stifles me.
You refused last summer when I asked you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to let me go up to Grenfell's Mission on the
Labrador. I could go now, at least as far
as the Newfoundland Station. Have you
changed your mind?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I think it is an exceedingly
foolish enterprise. It would interrupt the
career that I have marked out for you."</p>

<p>"Well, then, here's a cheaper proposition.
Algy Vanderhoof wants me to join him on
his yacht with&mdash;well, with a little party&mdash;to
cruise in the West Indies. Would you
prefer that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not! The Vanderhoof set
is wild and godless&mdash;I do not wish to see
you keeping company with fools who walk
in the broad and easy way that leads to
perdition."</p>

<p>"It is rather a hard choice," said the
young man, with a short laugh, turning
toward the door. "According to you
there's very little difference&mdash;a fool's para<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>dise
or a fool's hell! Well, it's one or the
other for me, and I'll toss up for it to-night:
heads, I lose; tails, the devil wins. Anyway,
I'm sick of this, and I'm out of
it."</p>

<p>"Harold," said the older man (and there
was a slight tremor in his voice), "don't let
us quarrel on Christmas Eve. All I want
is to persuade you to think seriously of the
duties and responsibilities to which God has
called you&mdash;don't speak lightly of heaven
and hell&mdash;remember, there is another life."</p>

<p>The young man came back and laid his
hand upon his father's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Father," he said, "I want to remember
it. I try to believe in it. But somehow
or other, in this house, it all seems unreal
to me. No doubt all you say is perfectly
right and wise. I don't venture to argue
against it, but I can't feel it&mdash;that's all.
If I'm to have a soul, either to lose or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
save, I must really live. Just now neither
the present nor the future means anything
to me. But surely we won't quarrel. I'm
very grateful to you, and we'll part friends.
Good-night, sir."</p>

<p>The father held out his hand in silence.
The heavy portière dropped noiselessly behind
the son, and he went up the wide,
curving stairway to his own room.</p>

<p>Meantime John Weightman sat in his
carved chair in the Jacobean dining-room.
He felt strangely old and dull. The portraits
of beautiful women by Lawrence and
Reynolds and Raeburn, which had often
seemed like real company to him, looked
remote and uninteresting. He fancied something
cold and almost unfriendly in their
expression, as if they were staring through
him or beyond him. They cared nothing
for his principles, his hopes, his disappointments,
his successes; they belonged to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>other
world, in which he had no place. At
this he felt a vague resentment, a sense of
discomfort that he could not have defined
or explained. He was used to being considered,
respected, appreciated at his full
value in every region, even in that of his
own dreams.</p>

<p>Presently he rang for the butler, telling
him to close the house and not to sit up, and
walked with lagging steps into the long
library, where the shaded lamps were burning.
His eye fell upon the low shelves full
of costly books, but he had no desire to
open them. Even the carefully chosen
pictures that hung above them seemed to
have lost their attraction. He paused for a
moment before an idyll of Corot&mdash;a dance
of nymphs around some forgotten altar in a
vaporous glade&mdash;and looked at it curiously.
There was something rapturous and serene
about the picture, a breath of spring-time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
in the misty trees, a harmony of joy in the
dancing figures, that wakened in him a
feeling of half-pleasure and half-envy. It
represented something that he had never
known in his calculated, orderly life. He
was dimly mistrustful of it.</p>

<p>"It is certainly very beautiful," he
thought, "but it is distinctly pagan; that
altar is built to some heathen god. It does
not fit into the scheme of a Christian life. I
doubt whether it is consistent with the tone
of my house. I will sell it this winter. It
will bring three or four times what I paid for
it. That was a good purchase, a very good
bargain."</p>

<p>He dropped into the revolving chair before
his big library table. It was covered
with pamphlets and reports of the various
enterprises in which he was interested.
There was a pile of newspaper clippings in
which his name was mentioned with praise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
for his sustaining power as a pillar of finance,
for his judicious benevolence, for his support
of wise and prudent reform movements, for
his discretion in making permanent public
gifts&mdash;"the Weightman Charities," one
very complaisant editor called them, as if
they deserved classification as a distinct
species.</p>

<p>He turned the papers over listlessly.
There was a description and a picture of
the "Weightman Wing of the Hospital for
Cripples," of which he was president; and
an article on the new professor in the
"Weightman Chair of Political Jurisprudence"
in Jackson University, of which he
was a trustee; and an illustrated account
of the opening of the "Weightman Grammar-School"
at Dulwich-on-the-Sound,
where he had his legal residence for purposes
of taxation.</p>

<p>This last was perhaps the most carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
planned of all the Weightman Charities.
He desired to win the confidence and support
of his rural neighbors. It had pleased him
much when the local newspaper had spoken
of him as an ideal citizen and the logical
candidate for the Governorship of the State;
but upon the whole it seemed to him wiser
to keep out of active politics. It would be
easier and better to put Harold into the
running, to have him sent to the Legislature
from the Dulwich district, then to the
national House, then to the Senate. Why
not? The Weightman interests were large
enough to need a direct representative and
guardian at Washington.</p>

<p>But to-night all these plans came back
to him with dust upon them. They were
dry and crumbling like forsaken habitations.
The son upon whom his complacent ambition
had rested had turned his back upon
the mansion of his father's hopes. The break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
might not be final; and in any event there
would be much to live for; the fortunes of
the family would be secure. But the zest
of it all would be gone if John Weightman
had to give up the assurance of perpetuating
his name and his principles in his son. It
was a bitter disappointment, and he felt that
he had not deserved it.</p>

<p>He rose from the chair and paced the
room with leaden feet. For the first time
in his life his age was visibly upon him. His
head was heavy and hot, and the thoughts
that rolled in it were confused and depressing.
Could it be that he had made a mistake
in the principles of his existence?
There was no argument in what Harold had
said&mdash;it was almost childish&mdash;and yet it had
shaken the elder man more deeply than he
cared to show. It held a silent attack which
touched him more than open criticism.</p>

<p>Suppose the end of his life were nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
than he thought&mdash;the end must come some
time&mdash;what if it were now? Had he not
founded his house upon a rock? Had he
not kept the Commandments? Was he not,
"touching the law, blameless"? And beyond
this, even if there were some faults in
his character&mdash;and all men are sinners&mdash;yet
he surely believed in the saving doctrines
of religion&mdash;the forgiveness of sins, the
resurrection of the body, the life everlasting.
Yes, that was the true source of comfort,
after all. He would read a bit in the Bible,
as he did every night, and go to bed and to
sleep.</p>

<p>He went back to his chair at the library
table. A strange weight of weariness rested
upon him, but he opened the book at a
familiar place, and his eyes fell upon the
verse at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>"<i>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
earth.</i>"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>That had been the text of the sermon a
few weeks before. Sleepily, heavily, he
tried to fix his mind upon it and recall it.
What was it that Doctor Snodgrass had
said? Ah, yes&mdash;that it was a mistake to
pause here in reading the verse. We must
read on without a pause&mdash;<i>Lay not up treasures
upon earth where moth and rust do corrupt
and where thieves break through and
steal</i>&mdash;that was the true doctrine. We may
have treasures upon earth, but they must
not be put into unsafe places, but into safe
places. A most comforting doctrine! He
had always followed it. Moths and rust and
thieves had done no harm to his investments.</p>

<p>John Weightman's drooping eyes turned
to the next verse, at the top of the second
column.</p>

<p>"<i>But lay up for yourselves treasures in
heaven.</i>"</p>

<p>Now what had the Doctor said about that?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
How was it to be understood&mdash;in what sense&mdash;treasures&mdash;in
heaven?</p>

<p>The book seemed to float away from him.
The light vanished. He wondered dimly
if this could be Death, coming so suddenly,
so quietly, so irresistibly. He struggled
for a moment to hold himself up, and
then sank slowly forward upon the table.
His head rested upon his folded hands. He
slipped into the unknown.</p>

<hr />

<p>How long afterward conscious life returned
to him he did not know. The blank
might have been an hour or a century. He
knew only that something had happened in
the interval. What it was he could not tell.
He found great difficulty in catching the
thread of his identity again. He felt that he
was himself; but the trouble was to make
his connections, to verify and place himself,
to know who and where he was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>At last it grew clear. John Weightman
was sitting on a stone, not far from a road
in a strange land.</p>

<p>The road was not a formal highway,
fenced and graded. It was more like a
great travel-trace, worn by thousands of
feet passing across the open country in the
same direction. Down in the valley, into
which he could look, the road seemed to
form itself gradually out of many minor
paths; little footways coming across the
meadows, winding tracks following along
beside the streams, faintly marked trails
emerging from the woodlands. But on the
hillside the threads were more firmly woven
into one clear band of travel, though there
were still a few dim paths joining it here and
there, as if persons had been climbing up
the hill by other ways and had turned at last
to seek the road.</p>

<p>From the edge of the hill, where John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Weightman sat, he could see the travelers,
in little groups or larger companies, gathering
from time to time by the different paths,
and making the ascent. They were all
clothed in white, and the form of their
garments was strange to him; it was like
some old picture. They passed him, group
after group, talking quietly together or
singing; not moving in haste, but with a
certain air of eagerness and joy as if they
were glad to be on their way to an appointed
place. They did not stay to speak to him,
but they looked at him often and spoke to
one another as they looked; and now and
then one of them would smile and beckon
him a friendly greeting, so that he felt they
would like him to be with them.</p>

<p>There was quite an interval between the
groups; and he followed each of them with
his eyes after it had passed, blanching
the long ribbon of the road for a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
transient space, rising and receding across
the wide, billowy upland, among the rounded
hillocks of aerial green and gold and
lilac, until it came to the high horizon, and
stood outlined for a moment, a tiny cloud of
whiteness against the tender blue, before it
vanished over the hill.</p>

<p>For a long time he sat there watching and
wondering. It was a very different world
from that in which his mansion on the
Avenue was built; and it looked strange to
him, but most real&mdash;as real as anything he
had ever seen. Presently he felt a strong
desire to know what country it was and
where the people were going. He had a
faint premonition of what it must be, but he
wished to be sure. So he rose from the
stone where he was sitting, and came down
through the short grass and the lavender
flowers, toward a passing group of people.
One of them turned to meet him, and held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
out his hand. It was an old man, under
whose white beard and brows John Weightman
thought he saw a suggestion of the
face of the village doctor who had cared for
him years ago, when he was a boy in the
country.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/gs03.jpg" width="350" height="329" alt="&quot;Welcome! Will you come with us?&quot;" title="&quot;Welcome! Will you come with us?&quot;" />
</div>

<p>"Welcome," said the old man. "Will
you come with us?"</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"To the heavenly city, to see our mansions
there."</p>

<p>"And who are these with you?"</p>

<p>"Strangers to me, until a little while
ago; I know them better now. But you I
have known for a long time, John Weightman.
Don't you remember your old doctor?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he cried&mdash;"yes; your voice has
not changed at all. I'm glad indeed to see
you, Doctor McLean, especially now. All
this seems very strange to me, almost oppressive.
I wonder if&mdash;but may I go with you,
do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"Surely," answered the doctor, with his
familiar smile; "it will do you good. And
you also must have a mansion in the city
waiting for you&mdash;a fine one, too&mdash;are you not
looking forward to it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the other, hesitating a
moment; "yes&mdash;I believe it must be so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
although I had not expected to see it so
soon. But I will go with you, and we can
talk by the way."</p>

<p>The two men quickly caught up with the
other people, and all went forward together
along the road. The doctor had little to
tell of his experience, for it had been a plain,
hard life, uneventfully spent for others, and
the story of the village was very simple.
John Weightman's adventures and triumphs
would have made a far richer, more imposing
history, full of contacts with the great
events and personages of the time. But
somehow or other he did not care to speak
much about it, walking on that wide heavenly
moorland, under that tranquil, sunless
arch of blue, in that free air of perfect peace,
where the light was diffused without a
shadow, as if the spirit of life in all things
were luminous.</p>

<p>There was only one person besides the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
doctor in that little company whom John
Weightman had known before&mdash;an old bookkeeper
who had spent his life over a desk,
carefully keeping accounts&mdash;a rusty, dull
little man, patient and narrow, whose wife
had been in the insane asylum for twenty
years and whose only child was a crippled
daughter, for whose comfort and happiness
he had toiled and sacrificed himself without
stint. It was a surprise to find him here, as
care-free and joyful as the rest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs04.jpg" width="400" height="273" alt="That free air of Perfect Peace" title="That free air of Perfect Peace" />
</div>

<p>The lives of others in the company were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
revealed in brief glimpses as they talked
together&mdash;a mother, early widowed, who
had kept her little flock of children together
and labored through hard and heavy years
to bring them up in purity and knowledge&mdash;a
Sister of Charity who had devoted herself
to the nursing of poor folk who were being
eaten to death by cancer&mdash;a schoolmaster
whose heart and life had been poured into his
quiet work of training boys for a clean and
thoughtful manhood&mdash;a medical missionary
who had given up a brilliant career in science
to take the charge of a hospital in darkest
Africa&mdash;a beautiful woman with silver hair
who had resigned her dreams of love and
marriage to care for an invalid father, and
after his death had made her life a long,
steady search for ways of doing kindnesses
to others&mdash;a poet who had walked among
the crowded tenements of the great city,
bringing cheer and comfort not only by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
songs, but by his wise and patient works of
practical aid&mdash;a paralyzed woman who had
lain for thirty years upon her bed, helpless
but not hopeless, succeeding by a miracle of
courage in her single aim, never to complain,
but always to impart a bit of her joy and
peace to every one who came near her. All
these, and other persons like them, people
of little consideration in the world, but now
seemingly all full of great contentment and
an inward gladness that made their steps
light, were in the company that passed along
the road, talking together of things past and
things to come, and singing now and then
with clear voices from which the veil of age
and sorrow was lifted.</p>

<p>John Weightman joined in some of the
songs&mdash;which were familiar to him from their
use in the church&mdash;at first with a touch of
hesitation, and then more confidently. For
as they went on his sense of strangeness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
fear at his new experience diminished, and
his thoughts began to take on their habitual
assurance and complacency. Were not these
people going to the Celestial City? And
was not he in his right place among them?
He had always looked forward to this journey.
If they were sure, each one, of finding
a mansion there, could not he be far more
sure? His life had been more fruitful than
theirs. He had been a leader, a founder of
new enterprises, a pillar of Church and State,
a prince of the House of Israel. Ten talents
had been given him, and he had made them
twenty. His reward would be proportionate.
He was glad that his companions
were going to find fit dwellings prepared for
them; but he thought also with a certain
pleasure of the surprise that some of them
would feel when they saw his appointed
mansion.</p>

<p>So they came to the summit of the moor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>land
and looked over into the world beyond.
It was a vast, green plain, softly rounded like
a shallow vase, and circled with hills of
amethyst. A broad, shining river flowed
through it, and many silver threads of water
were woven across the green; and there were
borders of tall trees on the banks of the
river, and orchards full of roses abloom
along the little streams, and in the midst of
all stood the city, white and wonderful and
radiant.</p>

<p>When the travelers saw it they were filled
with awe and joy. They passed over the
little streams and among the orchards
quickly and silently, as if they feared to
speak lest the city should vanish.</p>

<p>The wall of the city was very low, a child
could see over it, for it was made only of
precious stones, which are never large. The
gate of the city was not like a gate at all,
for it was not barred with iron or wood, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
only a single pearl, softly gleaming, marked
the place where the wall ended and the entrance
lay open.</p>

<p>A person stood there whose face was
bright and grave, and whose robe was like
the flower of the lily, not a woven fabric, but
a living texture. "Come in," he said to
the company of travelers; "you are at your
journey's end, and your mansions are ready
for you."</p>

<p>John Weightman hesitated, for he was
troubled by a doubt. Suppose that he was
not really, like his companions, at his journey's
end, but only transported for a little
while out of the regular course of his life
into this mysterious experience? Suppose
that, after all, he had not really passed
through the door of death, like these others,
but only through the door of dreams, and
was walking in a vision, a living man among
the blessed dead. Would it be right for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
to go with them into the heavenly city?
Would it not be a deception, a desecration,
a deep and unforgivable offense? The
strange, confusing question had no reason
in it, as he very well knew; for if he was
dreaming, then it was all a dream; but if his
companions were real, then he also was with
them in reality, and if they had died then
he must have died too. Yet he could not
rid his mind of the sense that there was a
difference between them and him, and it
made him afraid to go on. But, as he
paused and turned, the Keeper of the Gate
looked straight and deep into his eyes, and
beckoned to him. Then he knew that it
was not only right but necessary that he
should enter.</p>

<p>They passed from street to street among
fair and spacious dwellings, set in amaranthine
gardens, and adorned with an infinitely
varied beauty of divine simplicity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
The mansions differed in size, in shape, in
charm: each one seemed to have its own
personal look of loveliness; yet all were
alike in fitness to their place, in harmony
with one another, in the addition which each
made to the singular and tranquil splendor
of the city.</p>

<p>As the little company came, one by one, to
the mansions which were prepared for them,
and their Guide beckoned to the happy
inhabitant to enter in and take possession,
there was a soft murmur of joy, half wonder
and half recognition; as if the new and
immortal dwelling were crowned with the
beauty of surprise, lovelier and nobler than
all the dreams of it had been; and yet also
as if it were touched with the beauty of
the familiar, the remembered, the long-loved.
One after another the travelers were
led to their own mansions, and went in
gladly; and from within, through the open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
doorways, came sweet voices of welcome,
and low laughter, and song.</p>

<p>At last there was no one left with the
Guide but the two old friends, Doctor McLean
and John Weightman. They were
standing in front of one of the largest and
fairest of the houses, whose garden glowed
softly with radiant flowers. The Guide laid
his hand upon the doctor's shoulder.</p>

<p>"This is for you," he said. "Go in;
there is no more pain here, no more death,
nor sorrow, nor tears; for your old enemies
are all conquered. But all the good that
you have done for others, all the help that
you have given, all the comfort that you
have brought, all the strength and love that
you have bestowed upon the suffering, are
here; for we have built them all into this
mansion for you."</p>

<p>The good man's face was lighted with
a still joy. He clasped his old friend's hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
closely, and whispered: "How wonderful
it is! Go on, you will come to your mansion
next, it is not far away, and we shall see
each other again soon, very soon."</p>

<p>So he went through the garden, and into
the music within. The Keeper of the Gate
turned to John Weightman with level, quiet,
searching eyes. Then he asked, gravely:</p>

<p>"Where do you wish me to lead you
now?"</p>

<p>"To see my own mansion," answered the
man, with half-concealed excitement. "Is
there not one here for me? You may not
let me enter it yet, perhaps, for I must confess
to you that I am only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," said the Keeper of the Gate&mdash;"I
know it all. You are John Weightman."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the man, more firmly than
he had spoken at first, for it gratified him
that his name was known. "Yes, I am
John Weightman, Senior Warden of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Petronius' Church. I wish very much to see
my mansion here, if only for a moment. I
believe that you have one for me. Will you
take me to it?"</p>

<p>The Keeper of the Gate drew a little book
from the breast of his robe and turned over
the pages.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said, with a curious look
at the man, "your name is here; and you
shall see your mansion if you will follow
me."</p>

<p>It seemed as if they must have walked
miles and miles, through the vast city, passing
street after street of houses larger and
smaller, of gardens richer and poorer, but all
full of beauty and delight. They came into
a kind of suburb, where there were many
small cottages, with plots of flowers, very
lowly, but bright and fragrant. Finally
they reached an open field, bare and lonely-looking.
There were two or three little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
bushes in it, without flowers, and the grass
was sparse and thin. In the center of the
field was a tiny hut, hardly big enough for a
shepherd's shelter. It looked as if it had
been built of discarded things, scraps and
fragments of other buildings, put together
with care and pains, by some one who had
tried to make the most of cast-off material.
There was something pitiful and shamefaced
about the hut. It shrank and drooped and
faded in its barren field, and seemed to
cling only by sufferance to the edge of the
splendid city.</p>

<p>"This," said the Keeper of the Gate,
standing still and speaking with a low,
distinct voice&mdash;"this is your mansion, John
Weightman."</p>

<p>An almost intolerable shock of grieved
wonder and indignation choked the man for
a moment so that he could not say a word.
Then he turned his face away from the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
little hut and began to remonstrate eagerly
with his companion.</p>

<p>"Surely, sir," he stammered, "you must
be in error about this. There is something
wrong&mdash;some other John Weightman&mdash;a
confusion of names&mdash;the book must be
mistaken."</p>

<p>"There is no mistake," said the Keeper
of the Gate, very calmly; "here is your
name, the record of your title and your
possessions in this place."</p>

<p>"But how could such a house be prepared
for me," cried the man, with a resentful
tremor in his voice&mdash;"for me, after my long
and faithful service? Is this a suitable
mansion for one so well known and devoted?
Why is it so pitifully small and mean? Why
have you not built it large and fair, like the
others?"</p>

<p>"That is all the material you sent us."</p>

<p>"What!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have used all the material that you
sent us," repeated the Keeper of the Gate.</p>

<p>"Now I know that you are mistaken,"
cried the man, with growing earnestness,
"for all my life long I have been doing things
that must have supplied you with material.
Have you not heard that I have built a
school-house; the wing of a hospital; two&mdash;yes,
three&mdash;small churches, and the greater
part of a large one, the spire of St. Petro&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Keeper of the Gate lifted his hand.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said; "we know all these
things. They were not ill done. But
they were all marked and used as foundation
for the name and mansion of John
Weightman in the world. Did you not plan
them for that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the man, confused and
taken aback, "I confess that I thought often
of them in that way. Perhaps my heart was
set upon that too much. But there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
other things&mdash;my endowment for the college&mdash;my
steady and liberal contributions
to all the established charities&mdash;my support
of every respectable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait," said the Keeper of the Gate
again. "Were not all these carefully recorded
on earth where they would add to
your credit? They were not foolishly done.
Verily, you have had your reward for them.
Would you be paid twice?"</p>

<p>"No," cried the man, with deepening
dismay, "I dare not claim that. I acknowledge
that I considered my own interest too
much. But surely not altogether. You
have said that these things were not foolishly
done. They accomplished some good in
the world. Does not that count for something?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the Keeper of the Gate,
"it counts in the world&mdash;where you counted
it. But it does not belong to you here. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
have saved and used everything that you sent
us. This is the mansion prepared for you."</p>

<p>As he spoke, his look grew deeper and more
searching, like a flame of fire. John Weightman
could not endure it. It seemed to strip
him naked and wither him. He sank to the
ground under a crushing weight of shame,
covering his eyes with his hands and cowering
face downward upon the stones. Dimly
through the trouble of his mind he felt their
hardness and coldness.</p>

<p>"Tell me, then," he cried, brokenly,
"since my life has been so little worth, how
came I here at all?"</p>

<p>"Through the mercy of the King"&mdash;the
answer was like the soft tolling of a bell.</p>

<p>"And how have I earned it?" he murmured.</p>

<p>"It is never earned; it is only given,"
came the clear, low reply.</p>

<p>"But how have I failed so wretchedly,"
he asked, "in all the purpose of my life?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
What could I have done better? What is it
that counts here?"</p>

<p>"Only that which is truly given," answered
the bell-like voice. "Only that good
which is done for the love of doing it. Only
those plans in which the welfare of others is
the master thought. Only those labors in
which the sacrifice is greater than the reward.
Only those gifts in which the giver
forgets himself."</p>

<p>The man lay silent. A great weakness,
an unspeakable despondency and humiliation
were upon him. But the face of the
Keeper of the Gate was infinitely tender as
he bent over him.</p>

<p>"Think again, John Weightman. Has
there been nothing like that in your life?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he sighed. "If there ever
were such things, it must have been long
ago&mdash;they were all crowded out&mdash;I have
forgotten them."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>There was an ineffable smile on the face
of the Keeper of the Gate, and his hand
made the sign of the cross over the bowed
head as he spoke gently:</p>

<p>"These are the things that the King never
forgets; and because there were a few of them
in your life, you have a little place here."</p>

<hr />

<p>The sense of coldness and hardness under
John Weightman's hands grew sharper and
more distinct. The feeling of bodily weariness
and lassitude weighed upon him, but
there was a calm, almost a lightness, in his
heart as he listened to the fading vibrations
of the silvery bell-tones. The chimney clock
on the mantel had just ended the last stroke
of seven as he lifted his head from the table.
Thin, pale strips of the city morning were
falling into the room through the narrow
partings of the heavy curtains.</p>

<p>What was it that had happened to him?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Had he been ill? Had he died and come
to life again? Or had he only slept, and
had his soul gone visiting in dreams? He
sat for some time, motionless, not lost, but
finding himself in thought. Then he took
a narrow book from the table drawer, wrote
a check, and tore it out.</p>

<p>He went slowly up the stairs, knocked
very softly at his son's door, and, hearing no
answer, entered without noise. Harold was
asleep, his bare arm thrown above his head,
and his eager face relaxed in peace. His
father looked at him a moment with strangely
shining eyes, and then tiptoed quietly to
the writing-desk, found a pencil and a sheet
of paper, and wrote rapidly:</p>

<p>"My dear boy, here is what you asked
me for; do what you like with it, and ask for
more if you need it. If you are still thinking
of that work with Grenfell, we'll talk it over
to-day after church. I want to know your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
heart better; and if I have made mistakes&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/gs05.jpg" width="400" height="278" alt="&quot;God give us a good Christmas together&quot;" title="&quot;God give us a good Christmas together&quot;" />
</div>

<p>A slight noise made him turn his head.
Harold was sitting up in bed with wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p>"Father!" he cried, "is that you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my son," answered John Weightman;
"I've come back&mdash;I mean I've come
up&mdash;no, I mean come in&mdash;well, here I am,
and God give us a good Christmas together."</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
